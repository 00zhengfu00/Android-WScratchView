====================

Usage:
1. Git clone the project git://github.com/winsontan520/Android-WScratchView.git
2. For Eclipse, Import > Existing Android Code Into Workspace > Browse folder WScratchViewLibrary > Finish
3. Build the imported library project
4. Include the library in your project by right click your project > Android > In library tab click Add and choose the imported library
For testing, you may use sample project by import the folder testWScratchView and add the library
